======================

Javascript-based Cryptography tools, experiments, and musings.

So far, all I've made is a tool to convert text into a binary image [(Live Demo)](http://www.sergiopantoja.com/dev/sunflower-cryptography/text-to-binary-image.html). Screenshot below:

This was built in pure Javascript, which means it can be saved locally and run in a browser without any internet connection. This has the added protection of not needing to send the raw message to a server in order to get back an encrypted version.

[Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) was used for the CSS and the background image came courtesy of [SubtlePatterns](https://github.com/subtlepatterns/SubtlePatterns).

More tools coming soon!
