Sunflower Steganography
======================

I want my stenographic materials to be as beautiful and interesing as sunflowers. I want them to be out in the public. I want people to walk up to them, smile at them, observe them, contemplate them. I want some people to be clueless. I want some people to know there is something deeper inside. I want to bridge digital stenography with the physical world in this way. And I want to do it in Javascript.

So far, all I've made is a tool to convert text into a binary image [(Live Demo)](http://www.sergiopantoja.com/dev/sunflower-cryptography/text-to-binary-image.html). Screenshot below:

This was built in pure Javascript, which means it can be saved locally and run in a browser without any internet connection. This has the added protection of not needing to send the raw message to a server in order to get back an encrypted version.

[Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) was used for the CSS and the background image came courtesy of [SubtlePatterns](https://github.com/subtlepatterns/SubtlePatterns).

More tools coming soon!
